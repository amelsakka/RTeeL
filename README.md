RTeeL (R-Tee-L)
===============

RTeeL (R-Tee-L) converts RTL connected text to a form that could be rendered properly on systems that doesn't support RTL and connected letters.

Files need to be saved using UTF-8 Encoding (you can use even Notepad for that).

It currently supports Arabic. 
Please contact me if you are interested in adding other languages (like Farsi/Persian), even without any programming skills.
